## Configuration within theme.

If your theme does not use composer, you will need to `composer init` within your active theme.

Once you have a `composer.json` file generated, add the following snippet to your `composer.json` file. This will
instruct composer to run scripts in this codebase in the proper order.

Then run `composer install`.
